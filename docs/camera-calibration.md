# Calibrating Pi Cam v2.1

Reference documentation for camera calibration:
- https://medium.com/starschema-blog/offline-camera-calibration-in-ros-2-45e81df12555
- https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/docs/camera_calibration.html

Camera node should be run on Pi and Calibration GUI on a laptop/desktop. Make sure both have the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID set:

export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1

## Checkerboard
Checkerboard can be [found here](./assets/calib.io_checker_200x150_8x10_15.pdf). Be sure when printing to print at 100% so your printer does not scale the image. Each checker should be 15x15mm as specified in the [pattern generator](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator).

![Sample checkerboard](./assets/pattern_generator.png)

The size of this board is 7x9 (interior corners) with a square size of 0.015 (in meters). It's best to tape the checkerboard to cardboard or something rigid so the paper doesn't fold.

## Raspberry Pi Side

For Pi cam v2 and v2.1 make sure to have your pi /boot/firmware/config.txt properly set:

```
#camera_auto_detect=1
start_x=1
```

Then run:

```
ros2 run cv_camera cv_camera_node --ros-args -r __ns:=/camera
```

This is from: https://github.com/Kapernikov/cv_camera

The namespace of /camera is important so that on the laptop/desktop it finds the /camera/image_raw topic and we can do the calibration.

## Laptop side

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-camera-calibration
```

Now run:

```
ros2 run camera_calibration cameracalibrator --size 7x9 --square 0.015 --ros-args -r image:=/image_raw
```

Move your board around the camera and wait for all sliders to turn green as shown below.

![GUI](./assets/gui_calibrate.png)

Click calibrate and the intrinsic params will be printed to the console.

![Calibration](./assets/gui_save.png)

Click save and a calibrationdata.tar.gz will be saved to the /tmp folder on your desktop. The file that we want is ost.yaml, which has the calibration config.

Now run the camera node and you should a nice image with a good frame rate.

```
 ros2 run cv_camera cv_camera_node --ros-args -r __ns:=/camera -p camera_info_url:=file:///home/droneblocks/dexi_ws/src/dexi/camera_info/main_camera_2.1.yaml
 ```

 NOTE: we need to find the best place to put this file. The calibration should only need to be run once for all cameras of a certain type, in our case cam v2.1.

 When running the node you should hopefully see the param file loaded properly:

 ```
 [INFO] [1714425307.072069671] [camera.cv_camera]: camera calibration URL: file:///home/droneblocks/dexi_ws/src/dexi/camera_info/main_camera_2.1.yaml
 ```

 You can see the params being published at the following topic:

 ```
 ros2 topic echo /camera/camera_info
 ```

 and check out the frame rate:

 ```
 ros2 topic hz /camera/image_raw
 average rate: 30.135
